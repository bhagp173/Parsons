This is my code snippet:


```rudy

var firstName = "Yury" 
undefined
var lastName = "Gitman"
undefined
var fullName = firstName + lastName
undefined
fullName
"YuryGitman"
var firstLetter = firstName.slice(0.1)
undefined
var lastLetter = lastName.slice(0.1)
undefined
var lastLetter = lastName.slice(0,1)
undefined
la
VM578:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: la is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:1
(anonymous) @ VM578:1
lastLetter
"G"

```
